# 2022-code-CDC-A-Distributed-Linear-Quadratic-Discrete-Time-Game-Approach-to-Multi-Agent-Consensus

## General
This repository contains an implementation of the algorithms and simulations described in 
> Prima Aditya and Herbert Werner, "A Distributed Linear Quadratic Discrete-Time Game Approach to Multi-Agent Consensus"_ submitted for CDC 2022

## Simulation
The main code `decoupling_lqdtg.m` contains everything in one file.

## Supplementary files
The supplementary files are uploaded in separate folders. 

## Prerequisites
The simulation code in this repository was tested in the following environment:
- *Windows 11* Pro Version 21H2
- *Matlab* 2020a
